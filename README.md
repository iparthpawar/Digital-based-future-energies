EVOLUTION OF DIGITALISATION IN THE ENERGY SECTOR:

The energy industry is changing a lot, and technology is playing a big role in making it happen. For example, companies are replacing old-fashioned meters with new digital ones that help people use less energy. Digital technology is also helping the industry create electricity in a cleaner way, which is important because we want to reduce pollution and make the energy system more environmentally friendly.

MAIN PROBLEMS OF THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SECTOR:

The renewable energy sector is facing several obstacles that are making it difficult for companies to operate smoothly. These impediments include:

1. Geographically dispersed energy data: Renewable energy sources like solar and wind are often located in remote areas, which makes it difficult to collect and manage data on energy production.

2. Lack of integrated platform: There is a lack of a unified platform to manage the different components of renewable energy systems, such as solar panels, wind turbines, and energy storage systems.

3. Inability to track assets: Companies often have difficulty tracking and managing their assets, such as wind turbines and solar panels, which can lead to inefficiencies and lost revenue.

4. Lack of clear and traceable objectives: There is a need for clearer and more traceable objectives for the renewable energy sector, such as targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions or increasing the use of renewable energy sources. Without clear objectives, it can be difficult for companies to plan and invest in renewable energy projects.
