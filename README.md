EVOLUTION OF DIGITALISATION IN THE ENERGY SECTOR:

The energy industry is changing a lot, and technology is playing a big role in making it happen. For example, companies are replacing old-fashioned meters with new digital ones that help people use less energy. Digital technology is also helping the industry create electricity in a cleaner way, which is important because we want to reduce pollution and make the energy system more environmentally friendly.

MAIN PROBLEMS OF THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SECTOR:

The renewable energy sector is facing several obstacles that are making it difficult for companies to operate smoothly. These impediments include:

1. Geographically dispersed energy data: Renewable energy sources like solar and wind are often located in remote areas, which makes it difficult to collect and manage data on energy production.

2. Lack of integrated platform: There is a lack of a unified platform to manage the different components of renewable energy systems, such as solar panels, wind turbines, and energy storage systems.

3. Inability to track assets: Companies often have difficulty tracking and managing their assets, such as wind turbines and solar panels, which can lead to inefficiencies and lost revenue.

4. Lack of clear and traceable objectives: There is a need for clearer and more traceable objectives for the renewable energy sector, such as targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions or increasing the use of renewable energy sources. Without clear objectives, it can be difficult for companies to plan and invest in renewable energy projects.

HERE ARE SOME REQUIREMENTS OR SCOPE FOR DIGITAL-BASED FUTURE ENERGIES THAT CAN BE USED TO DEVELOP SUITABLE TECHNOLOGY-ORIENTED DIGITAL SOLUTIONS:

1. Data Integration: Integration of data from different renewable energy sources, storage devices, and other equipment is essential for effective management and optimization of renewable energy systems.

2. Monitoring and Control: Continuous monitoring and control of renewable energy systems is critical to ensure efficient and reliable operation. This includes monitoring energy generation, storage, and consumption, as well as equipment performance and maintenance needs.

3. Predictive Analytics: Predictive analytics can help identify trends and patterns in energy consumption and generation, allowing for better decision-making and planning.

4. Cybersecurity: As renewable energy systems become more connected and digitized, cybersecurity becomes a critical requirement to protect against cyber attacks and data breaches.

5. Interoperability: Interoperability between different renewable energy systems, devices, and software is essential for seamless integration and efficient operation.

6. Scalability: Digital solutions for renewable energy systems must be scalable to accommodate growth in energy demand and changing energy needs.

7. User-Friendly Interfaces: User-friendly interfaces for digital solutions are critical for the adoption and effective use of renewable energy systems by a wide range of users.

8. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning can help optimize renewable energy systems, improve efficiency, and reduce costs.

9. Predictive Analytics: The digital solution should be able to predict energy demand and supply, and optimize energy production to meet the demand.

10. Open Standards: The digital solution should be based on open standards, allowing for interoperability with other systems and devices.
